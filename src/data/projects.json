It is designed to function as a touch screen in a museum, as part of an exhibition about Greenlandic identity. The experience invites you to click around and listen to people talk about the meaning behind their belongings. The site was created as part of a brief to design an experience about Greenland, following renewed international attention after the United States once again expressed interest in buying the island. Currently, the stories are fictional, and the faces are AI-generated using Midjourney. However, the goal is for the final version to feature real Greenlanders and their authentic objects.
